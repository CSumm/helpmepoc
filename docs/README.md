### Hey there!
Welcome to Help Me POC, an aggregated list of resources for communities of color in Montreal you can use to find help (from businesses to community centers) or to support and aid as an ally. We made sure that each business and organization on the list is owned or ran by someone who belongs to the community it is listed under.
